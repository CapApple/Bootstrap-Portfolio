                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <img id="me" src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="picture of me" width="240px">
                        <p> I am a next-door type guy with too many hobbies, according to my friends. They are right. I
                            love
                            traveling, biking, skiing, climbing, diving, board game, photography and film making. And
                            last
                            but
                            not least, I love bad jokes too! Among my numerous hobbies, Iâ€™m really serious about
                            photography
                            and filmmaking. Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan are two of my favorite directors. I
                            have
                            made a few short films and commercials, but I have always been dreaming about making a
                            feature
                            film
                            someday.</p>
                        <P> I have a keen eye for those little beautiful details and moments in life. And I enjoy
                            seeing
                            them
                            and realizing that life is good. That's why you can see me carrying my camera with me in a
                            lot
                            of
                            occasions, even on a Sunday coffe trip to downtown. I don't just photogrpah landscape, I
                            photogrpah
                            people too, and I am good at posing others. However, I really suck at smiling when I am on
                            the
                            other side of the camera.</P>
                        <p> I have a background in Electrical Engineering and Accounting, and I had fun. So why am I
                            here
                            now
                            studying web developing? Well, that's a long story. But I do believe that life is too short
                            to
                            not
                            live to its fullest. And by far, I have been enjoying every bit of this journey. So wish me
                            luck!</p>
